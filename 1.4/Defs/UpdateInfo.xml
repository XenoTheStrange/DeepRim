    <content>This update adds more vanilla-like icons for the drill-gizmos, made by Ontheheavens.
It also adds a new texture for the drill, based on the retexture-mod by sk4p3g04t and reworked by Ontheheavens.
The old drill-texture is still used if the low-tech option is enabled in the mod-settings.
If the low-tech option is changed any already built drills will now convert to the selected tech-level upon loading a save.
The manual drilling is now only possible on the low-tech drill as the new graphic does not really allow manual drilling.</content>
