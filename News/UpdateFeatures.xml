    <content>By request it is now possible to define how large the new layers drilled should be. Default is to inherit the colonys map-size but using the mod-settings this can for example be lowered to cause less of a performance impact.</content>

    <content>There is now a low-tech setting in the options. 
This will change the drill to not use power and not cost any components (but more metal).
The drill is then operated by a pawn and uses mining skill to mine.
Even in the normal mode the drill can now be used by pawns if its out of power.
Manual drilling takes a long time.

When the mode is changed in the mod-options you need to reload the save if you have already built drills for the drills to change.</content>

    <content>This update adds a highly requested feature, power-transfer between layers.
The drill on the top layer will now be able to send a set amount of power, splitted equally between the lower layers.
If the drill is not currently drilling it will send 1000W of its 1200W power-demand to the lower layers.
There is also possible to set an extra amount that should be sent, changed in 100W steps via gizmos on the drill.</content>
