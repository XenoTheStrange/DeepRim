    <content>By request it is now possible to define how large the new layers drilled should be. Default is to inherit the colonys map-size but using the mod-settings this can for example be lowered to cause less of a performance impact.</content>

    <content>There is now a low-tech setting in the options. 
This will change the drill to not use power and not cost any components (but more metal).
The drill is then operated by a pawn and uses mining skill to mine.
Even in the normal mode the drill can now be used by pawns if its out of power.
Manual drilling takes a long time.

When the mode is changed in the mod-options you need to reload the save if you have already built drills for the drills to change.</content>

    <content>Transfer items between layers automatically.
If there are any storage-buildings built next to the mine-shaft you can now select to automatically transfer items from these to a layer and reverse.</content>

    <content>This update adds a highly requested feature, power-transfer between layers.
The drill on the top layer will now be able to send a set amount of power, splitted equally between the lower layers.
If the drill is not currently drilling it will send 1000W of its 1200W power-demand to the lower layers.
There is also possible to set an extra amount that should be sent, changed in 100W steps via gizmos on the drill.</content>

    <assemblyVersion>1.4.8</assemblyVersion>
    <content>This update adds more vanilla-like icons for the drill-gizmos, made by Ontheheavens.
It also adds a new texture for the drill, based on the retexture-mod by sk4p3g04t and reworked by Ontheheavens.
The old drill-texture is still used if the low-tech option is enabled in the mod-settings.
If the low-tech option is changed any already built drills will now convert to the selected tech-level upon loading a save.
The manual drilling is now only possible on the low-tech drill as the new graphic does not really allow manual drilling.</content>
